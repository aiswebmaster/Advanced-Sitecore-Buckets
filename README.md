# Advanced Sitecore Buckets
This Sitecore Marketplace module solves several issues that are presented with today's implementation of buckets within Sitecore including the following items:

- Custom Bucketing Rules for more common scenarios including
	* Custom Date Fields
- Currently when you create a new item based on a non-standard Sitecore field, it will create the item, but will fail to bucket the item properly.  The solution is to provide the user with the ability to enter the field at item creation.


This module has been confirmed and tested with the following versions of Sitecore:

- Sitecore 8.2.3
